# Pupper picker
A go to website for dog owners for tools, resources, and facts.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Being dog owners, our motivation is to encourage new dog owners or aspiring dog owners to adopt responsibly with all the information provided. Should the user already be a dog owner, to provide additional information and facts that they did not know already.

The website should start getting the user to think about or start the adoption process by providing information and directing them to the organization that is caring for the dog.

### Javier's Learning
What I learned is that I need a better system for debugging. Although console logging and checking the web console is helpful, I need a better tool or method for a bird's eye view for what is going on. I learned what a header is when requesting information via API calls. My favorite thing I learned is that you can clone a section of html using cloneNode. 

### USER STORY
- **AS AN** Aspiring/Current dog owner,

- **I WANT** An application that will get me started in my research prior to my adoption process.

- **SO THAT** I am fully informed before making a big decision.
